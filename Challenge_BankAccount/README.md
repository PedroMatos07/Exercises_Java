In a bank, to register a bank account, it is necessary to provide the account number, the account holder's name, and the initial deposit amount that the holder made when opening the account. However, this initial deposit amount is optional, meaning that if the holder does not have money to deposit at the time of opening the account, the initial deposit will not be made, and the account balance will naturally be zero.

It is important to note that once a bank account is opened, the account number can never be changed. However, the account holder's name can be changed (for instance, in case of marriage). 

Finally, the account balance cannot be freely altered. A mechanism must be in place to protect it. The balance can only increase through deposits and decrease through withdrawals. For each withdrawal, the bank charges a fee of $5.00. Note: The account balance can become negative if the balance is insufficient to complete the withdrawal and/or pay the fee.

You need to create a program that registers an account, providing an option to either include or exclude the initial deposit amount. Then, the program should perform a deposit followed by a withdrawal, always showing the account details after each operation.
